1. **`AI/technical_considerations.md`** - Lessons learned and implementation decisions
1. **`AI/architecture.md`** - Overall architecture and design decisions

**Key workflow reminders:**
- Always use the TodoWrite tool to track story progress
- Follow the exact human verification format from pair_programming.md
